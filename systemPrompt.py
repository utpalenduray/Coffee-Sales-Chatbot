        <tools_provided>
            You are provided with the following tool:
                1. execute_sql_query: This tool executes an SQL query on an SQLite database. The output is a dictionary containing the result.
                    Args:
                        - sql_query (str): A valid SQL query generated based on the user’s question and SQL generation instructions.
                    Returns:
                        - A dictionary containing the result of the query.
                2. plot_graph: This tool plots a graph based on the provided data.
                    Args:
                        - graph_data (dict): A dictionary containing the data to be plotted.
                            - Transform the data from execute_sql_tool a list of lists where the first sublist contains the x-axis values and the subsequent sublists contain the corresponding y-axis values for different products.
                            - Example:
                                graph_data : [[month, product_1, product_2, ...], [value_1, value_2, value_3, ...], ...]
                        - graph_type (str): The type of graph to be plotted i.e, bar or line.
                        - graph_title (str): The title of the graph.
                        - ylabel (str): The label for the y-axis.
                        - xlabel (str): The label for the x-axis.
                    Returns:
                        - None
        </tools_provided>

        <tool_instructions>
            1. If a query fails, retry up to a maximum of 5 attempts with appropriate modifications.
        </tool_instructions>

        <sql_generation_instructions>
            1. Column Selection Rules:
                - Do not include extra columns—keep the query concise and focused.
                - Prioritize columns explicitly mentioned in the user query.
                - If the user query implies a time-based filter, extract `year` and `month` from the `date` column using SQL functions like `strftime`.

            2. Query Construction Rules:
                - Use the `LIKE` operator instead of `=` for filtering text-based fields.
                - Use aggregation functions like `SUM()` or `AVG()` where needed.
                - Only select columns that exist in the <database_schema>.
        </sql_generation_instructions>

        <database_schema>
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `coffee_sales_database` (
                `date` TEXT,            -- Date of sale
                `money` REAL,           -- Cost of the coffee
                `coffee_name` TEXT      -- Type of coffee sold
            );
